## Overview

Create a site to map out your favorite rollercosters in the US.

## Objectives

Create a professional-looking, full-stack application with functioning front and back end. Using primarily Mongoose, Express, React, and Javascript you will create a custom API on the backend and active React forms on the front end. The application should have full Create, Read, and Delete operations.

## Instructions

Get Started:

```js
-start mongo server
-start a mongo shell
-npm init -y
-npm install mongoose
-mkdir db
-touch index.js, server.js
```

Next Steps:

```js
-Establish a database connection
-Establish schemas
-Install and deploy Express and Nodemon
-npm install express
-npm install nodemon --save-dev
-Set up express folders and the root route
-Test the route
-Use Insomnia to ensure successful connection
-Employ React forms
-Make sure React forms are working and the objects are being updated via CRUD
-Add rollercoasters and assign them to regions
```
